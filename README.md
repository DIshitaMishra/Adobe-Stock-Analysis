# Adobe-Stock-Analysis
Adobe Stock Analysis Project

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of Adobe stock data, transforming raw data into an organized dataset, performing detailed analysis, and designing an interactive dashboard to provide actionable insights.

## Research and Data Acquisition
To locate and collect relevant stock data, I conducted extensive research, exploring various online sources and tools. My research involved in-depth internet exploration, ultimately leading me to data from sources like Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics. This allowed me to build a custom dataset tailored to meet the specific requirements of this analysis.

Adobe Analytics: https://experience.adobe.com/#/@aauniversity/so:adobea8cf/analytics/spa/#/workspace/projects

## Data Transformation and Cleaning
Using Excel, I cleaned and transformed the raw data to prepare it for analysis. This process included:

Data Wrangling: Merging multiple data sources into a single cohesive dataset.
Data Cleaning: Identifying and handling missing data or outliers to ensure data accuracy.
Filtering and Structuring: Filtering and organizing the data to meet the analysis requirements.

## Data Visualization and Dashboard Creation
I utilized Power BI to create an interactive dashboard, using various visualizations to capture different analytical insights. Each visualization was carefully chosen to address specific areas of analysis:

Revenue and Traffic Trends

Displayed "Online Revenue" over time to illustrate daily revenue trends.
Visualized "Visits" and "Unique Visitors" over time to compare traffic patterns.
Conversion Analysis

Plotted "Orders per Visit" over time to assess conversion rates.
Analyzed "Orders per Visit" against "Visits" to explore correlations between traffic and conversions.
User Engagement

Charted "Average Time Spent on Site (seconds)" over time to monitor user engagement.
Compared "Premium Enrollments" and "Email Enrollments" over time to observe enrollment types.
Content and Social Engagement

Displayed "Content Views" over time to understand content engagement trends.
Analyzed "Facebook Impressions" over time to evaluate the impact of social media.
Compared "Content Views" with "Content Ratings" by day to assess engagement quality.
Key Metrics Summary

Created KPI cards to present key metrics, including total "Online Revenue," average "Orders per Visit," and total "Premium Enrollments," offering a high-level summary of performance.
This dashboard provides an intuitive, data-driven view of Adobeâ€™s performance metrics, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions based on real-time data insights. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in data transformation, analysis, and visualization, honing my skills in data-driven storytelling using Power BI.
